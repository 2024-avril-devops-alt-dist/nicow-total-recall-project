# WELCOME

Hi, you're on my conception project for Total Recall.

# WHAT CHOICES I MADE

## User  
Minimalist, basic connection info & phone number / notification if he wants it.  
One user, a lot of booking (we hope).

## Booking  
In my project, you need to be connected to book a trip. So user_id is required.  

## Flight  
Date and time are grouped for datetime. You come from an airport, and you go to another one, we need both info (location and datetime).  

## Airport  
Airports are in a location, but a location may have more than one Airport.  

## Airline Company  
One company, one or more flights.  

## Stopover  
A stopover is different than a flight. You come to a stopover destination, and go back to your travel from the same location.  
Sometimes, you won't go out of the airplane.  So we need the location, and the datetime.  

## Passenger  
Passengers are not users, they won't connect, we just need basic info about them to checkout their identities.
